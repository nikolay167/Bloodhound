#	Bloodhound is a Web crawler that runs the whole day, indexing and tracking price changes of retail stores.
#	The idea is to store all the price changes for every product in their website, so as to ensure that a consumer can look up prices and that would enable him/her to buy a product at the best possible price. Moreover, the consumer can decide which store to visit in order to get the best price even before actually going out.
